	ANSWER:	1 (in 19.337 ms)

JUSTIFICATION_TREE:
1 is the winner of the game testgame, because
    1 is a rock paper scissors player, and
    2 is a rock paper scissors player, and
    testgame is a game of rock paper scissors, and
    1 participated in the game testgame, because
        it is assumed that 1 participated in the game testgame, and
        'abducible' holds (for player_in_game(1,testgame)), because
            'abducible' holds (for player_in_game(1,testgame)).
    2 participated in the game testgame, because
        it is assumed that 2 participated in the game testgame, and
        'abducible' holds (for player_in_game(2,testgame)), because
            'abducible' holds (for player_in_game(2,testgame)).
    1 threw rock, because
        it is assumed that 1 threw rock, and
        'abducible' holds (for player_threw_sign(1,rock)), because
            'abducible' holds (for player_threw_sign(1,rock)).
    2 threw scissors, because
        it is assumed that 2 threw scissors, and
        'abducible' holds (for player_threw_sign(2,scissors)), because
            'abducible' holds (for player_threw_sign(2,scissors)).
    rock beats scissors.
The global constraints hold, because
    the global constraint number 1 holds, because
        there is no evidence that 2 is the winner of the game Var2 not equal testgame, because
            2 is a rock paper scissors player, justified above, and
            there is no evidence that Var3 not equal 1, nor 2 is a rock paper scissors player, and
            1 is a rock paper scissors player, justified above, and
            there is no evidence that Var2 not equal testgame is a game of rock paper scissors.
        there is no evidence that 2 is the winner of the game testgame, because
            2 is a rock paper scissors player, justified above, and
            there is no evidence that Var4 not equal 1, nor 2 is a rock paper scissors player, and
            1 is a rock paper scissors player, justified above, and
            testgame is a game of rock paper scissors, justified above, and
            2 participated in the game testgame, justified above, and
            1 participated in the game testgame, justified above, and
            there is no evidence that 2 threw Var5 not equal scissors, because
                it is assumed that there is no evidence that 2 threw Var5 not equal scissors.
            2 threw scissors, justified above, and
            there is no evidence that 1 threw Var6 not equal rock, because
                it is assumed that there is no evidence that 1 threw Var6 not equal rock.
            1 threw rock, justified above, and
            there is no evidence that scissors beats rock.
